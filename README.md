# Queensland Government Web Template

**If you are using assets from this Repo, please send an email to oss.products@dsiti.qld.gov.au so we can add you to our change management communications list**

_This project is currently a work in progress._

## Getting started

A Git client is required to edit this template.

### 1. Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qld-gov-au/glue-template.git
```

### 2. Setup

**Make sure you have Node version >= 6.0 and NPM >= 3**

Install all the node packages (If behind a corporate web proxy please have a look at this website [How to setup Node.js and Npm behind a corporate web proxy](https://jjasonclark.com/how-to-setup-node-behind-web-proxy))
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Making changes - Create a branch

**WARNING: Do not work directly in 'working', 'beta', or 'master' branches**

To keep the repository clean, branches must be prefixed into categories with a forwardslash /. Categories come from JIRA and are (note capitalisation): 

- Bugfix: For bugs and errors that will be released on the standard schedule
- Feature: For new features
- Hotfix: For critical bugs and errors which will be merged into the current release
- Enhance: For refactoring, or general improvements to existing features that do not add new features

Add the JIRA job number after the category type, and your initials so we can track who's responsible for each branch. If there is no JIRA task, just add your initials.
Example: Bugfix/QOL-100-NE-Fixing-nav-nesting-issue
It's best to checkout files from working, or beta. *Note: working may not always be stable, in those instances use beta.*

**If you use git command line, use the following commands to create your branch**

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout working
git checkout -b Bugfix/QOL-100-NE-Fixing-nav-nesting-issue
```

Replace "Bugfix/QOL-100-NE-Fixing-nav-nesting-issue" with your branch.

### 4. Usage

**Compiles and lints the project into the build folder for smoke testing**
```bash
gulp build
```
**Run local server, as well as watch and lint js**
Remember to run 'build' first.
```bash
watch:serve
```
**Compiles the released assets for deployment. Note: This will also automatically run a clean build**
```bash
gulp release
```

#### Other commands

**Cleans up your build folder before running build, to keep things tidy**
```bash
gulp build:clean
```
**Command performs build as above then replaces ssi directives with JINJA2**
```bash
gulp build-jinja
```
**Watch and lint js**
```bash
gulp watch
```
**To start a local server**
```bash
gulp serve
```
**To run Unit tests and Linting tests**
```bash
gulp test
```

**To run E2E tests using Browserstack**. 

Please make sure to setup browserstack _config file_ (step 3) and run _gulp serve_ before running browserstack E2E tests
```bash
gulp test:browserstack --browsers _browser names_
```
_browser name_ can be a browser or multiple browsers,
for example chrome or ie,chrome,safari
We can add more browser configurations in conf.js

To view testing reports (coverage, eslint and unit test)
```bash
gulp serve --type=reports-server
```

### 5. Making a commit to git

Allways prefix your commit message with the JIRA task number - if you have a JIRA task.

```bash
git commit -m "QOL-100 - Your commit message"
```

### 6. Browserstack Setup
1.) Create a .env file in the root of your project

2.) Place Browserstack configs in this file =
```bash
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME = username
BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY = key
PROXYHOST = proxyhost (leave blank if no proxy)
PROXYPORT = proxyport (leave blank if no proxy)
PROXYPROTOCOL = proxyprotocol (leave blank if no proxy)
```

## Repo structure
This repo should contain three main branches. DO NOT WORK DIRECTLY INTO THESE BRANCHES. Instead create your own branch using the below 'creating new branches' instructions, and use a pull request to get that into the working branch.

- working: For integrating features for the next version
- beta: For testing
- master: The current live assets


## File structure

* gulp/ - Gulp functions and settings file
* product definitions/ - Definitions and requirements for this template
* src/ - This is where the source files for the template are kept
	* assets/
		* _project/ - SCSS, JS, external libraries, code-snippets, and images vital for the template to operate correctly. Files in here are compiled specially by gulp. Keep an eye on the build file when making changes. This directory will be renamed to the version number for the template (V3).
			* js/ - 
				* legacy/ - Old legacy components that are to be re-built, not linted
			* scss/ - 
		* images/ - Images for the template
		* includes - The main SSI includes. This folder is split into includes/ and includes-cdn/ (which are automatically re-written to point to CDN assets) on release.
	* documentation/ - The end user documentation on using this template
	* other-files/ - Special files for build and release
		* build/ - .htaccess file and other files required to get build to work. These are excluded on release.
		* release/ - readme.md and other files for the destination release repository. These are not included on build.
	* template/ - The template files that pull in the includes, css and js. These are automatically adjusted to point to local or CDN files on release.
* tests/ - All test functions
